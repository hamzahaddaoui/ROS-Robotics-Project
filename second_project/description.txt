Second project of Robotics, year 2020.
Made by Avvisati Giulio (ID 10608313) and Haddaoui Hamza (ID 10583761)

Requests:
1) Create maps using gmapping (both created with traj1)
2) Configure move_base with amcl and the computed map by visual odom
(optional)
3) Improve visual odometry using IMU (both sensors)


All provided solution require to move the folder "secondProject" to your catkin workspace src folder and launch the "catkin_make" command first (otherwise the command "$(find)" in yaml files won't work).
Please note that if you set the DEBUG parameter to "true" the launch file will open rviz with a configuration file and make data visualization more comfortable.

Some considerations:
- To convert from pointcloud to laserscan we have excluded all point planes above the sensor. Doing so we create a map considering obstacles from the ground to the robot height to obtain a useful map for moving.
- All the parameters used for the pointcloud have been taken from "https://ouster.com/products/os1-lidar-sensor" data sheet.
- Basic components have been written in Xml files and merged into launch file to provide code readability and reuse of the same.
- Move base has been configured to work with the provided frames and localization has been tested. Planner parameters are missing due to the impossibility of testing.
- Most of the parameters about refresh and scan frequencies should be tuned depending on the used hardware.


Structure of the TF tree:
 - Optitrack generated tree:  world -> Robot_1/BaseLink -> os1_sensor 
 - Visual generated tree: map -> camera_odom_frame -> camera_pose_frame -> os1_sensor



Content of the secondproject folder:
 - launch -> 
		EKF_DataFusion.xml : Fuses the data from the visual odometry and the two IMUs 
		pointCloud2LaserScan.xml : Converts the pointCloud data, to laser scan.
		
		amcl
			amcl_config.xml : Configuration parameters for the amcl.
			move_base_amcl.launch :	Launch file for the localization task.

		map_generate
			optitrack.launch: Launch file for mapping the environment with optitrack data.
			visual.launch: Launch file for mapping the environment with visual odometry data.
		
 - map    -> Generated maps from the bag, for visual and optitrack odom
 - rviz   -> Debug files for rviz visualization of the data



Bags:
 - Bag used to generate the map: 2020-05-14-16-09-36-traj1-os1-t265-pix.bag
 - Bag used to test the localization: 2020-05-14-16-14-37-traj2-os1-t265-pix.bag


How to start the mapping task:
1. Roslaunch optitrack.launch/visual.launch
2. Call "rosrun map_server map_saver -f map"

How to start the navigation task:
1. Roslaunch move_base_amcl.launch. (See the localization via rviz)
