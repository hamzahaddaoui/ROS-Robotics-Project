Robotics - first project

Content of the first_project folder:

 - cfg    -> Dynamic reconfiguration file (Python script to cfg flag thresholds)
 - launch -> Launch files (initial set point parameters, launches lla2enu nodes, distance service and publisher)
 - msg    -> Custom message definition files ((float64) distance and (string) flag)
 - srv    -> Service definition files (input: none, output: float64 distance)


Custom message:
float64 distance
string flag 

Structure of tf tree: 
map is the root TF. car_node and obs_node are child frames.
See attached file "frames.pdf"




How to start everything: 
 - roscore
 - roslaunch first_project first_project.launch



Other useful information 

 - car.mov is the odom data visualized on riva (8x speed)

 - The launch file, contains:
   - the initial LLA set point parameters
   - initialization of two lla2enu nodes, which performs the conversion from lla to enu and publishes odom and tf data;
	the first node is remapped to subscribe to the car gps data
	the second node is remapped to subscribe to the obstacle gps data
   - initialization of the distance service
   - initialization of the publisher
   - Opens the rqt_reconfigure tool -> reconfiguring threshold data for the publisher.

 - Distance service:
The distance service uses an ApproximateTime synchronization for the ENU data from car and obstacle.
When the two data are received, the distance is computed and then ready to be sent to the first client that requests it.
An important thing is that 0.5 seconds after this event (the reception of the two data), the distance expires, so if a client asks for the distance after that time, no data will be provided.

 - Publisher:
The publisher calls the distance service at a defined frequency (5Hz) and depending on response publish
es a message on his "data_publisher" topic.
If the distance service replies with a value, a custom message is built, with the received distance, and a flag based on dynamic config values (unsafe threshold, crash threshold) which can be SAFE, UNSAFE, CRASH.
If the distance service replies with an error, no data is available to be fetch, so the data_publisher will publish a nan distance value, with a NONE flag.

    -Why 5Hz? Using rostopic hz on both odom topics, the minimum freq is 8Hz and the maximum is around 12Hz.
Then since it is better to publish distance data at a lower frequency I decided to set this freq at 5Hz.
